The need for a Software Development Process
Software is developed for four common reasons:

To meet the specific needs of a specific client/business (the case with custom software)
To solve a real-world problem
For personal use (e.g., a pharmacy owner may require inventory managing and billing software.)
The demand for better quality management has enforced the discipline of software engineering, which focuses on applying the systematic approach of the engineering paradigm to the software development process.
